# Object-Detection-using-deep-learning-YOLO-Tensorflow-etc-Presentation
A detailed Presentation on Object Detection using deep learning models (for example YOLO, Tensorflow, etc) 

This was a presenation done in July 2019 at Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse (IRIT) research lab in Toulouse, France titled
DETECTION OF THE TYPES OF IMAGES (PHOTOS, VIDEOS) PUBLISHED BY POLITICAL PAGES ON FACEBOOK.

The objective of the presentation was to share insights on object detection via deep learning using neural networks, previous state of the art researches done, show case some of the results, tested on an in-house corpus of political images found on social media like Facebook, twitter, etc.

Some open questions were discussed at the end. Feel free to join the conversation.

Cheers!!!!
